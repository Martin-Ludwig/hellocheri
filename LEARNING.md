Insights, patterns, and pitfalls discovered during development.

## Monorepo with Bun Workspaces

- Bun workspaces are configured via `package.json` `workspaces` field at the project root
- Each sub-package gets its own `package.json` with a scoped name (e.g. `@notes/frontend`)
- Run `bun install` at the workspace root to install all dependencies across packages
- `bunfig.toml` at the project root configures Bun behavior per project
- `bun init -y` initialises a blank project non-interactively (creates index.ts, tsconfig.json, .gitignore, README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Run `bun add` from inside a workspace package dir to add deps to that package's package.json; always follow up with `bun install` at the workspace root
- Bun stores installed packages in `node_modules/.bun/` using its own internal layout (no traditional per-package symlinks at the root level)
- Tailwind CSS v4 package is `tailwindcss`; React types are `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` (both as devDependencies)

## SQLite with bun:sqlite (@lists/backend)

- Use `test()` not `it()` — `test()` is the documented API in `bun:test`; `it()` works as an undocumented Jest alias but should be avoided
- `bun:sqlite` is built-in — no extra dependency needed
- DB is initialised by running `schema.sql` via `db.exec(readFileSync(...))` on startup
- Use `INSERT OR IGNORE` for seed data so re-running the schema is safe
- SQLite has no booleans — use `INTEGER` (0/1); SQLite also has no stored procedures
- Derived/computed values (e.g. list `completed`) belong in a VIEW, not a stored column — avoids sync bugs with triggers
- snake_case in DB columns (`list_id`, `created_at`), camelCase in TypeScript (`listId`, `createdAt`) — map at the DB access layer
- Enum values in TS (`ItemStatus`) mirror the integer primary keys of the lookup table (`item_status`)
- i18n: store machine-readable codes in DB (`"default"`, `"completed"`), translate to display strings in the frontend

## LocalStorageManager (framework/)

- Bun's test environment has no `localStorage` — assign a mock to `globalThis.localStorage` in `beforeEach`
- Use `rehydrate: (raw: unknown) => T` to restore non-serializable types (e.g. `Date`) after JSON.parse
- `enabled: false` is the correct pattern for SSR, testing, and feature-flagged storage
- All storage operations should be wrapped in try/catch — JSON.parse can throw on corrupt data
